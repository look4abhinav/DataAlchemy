Convert Unstructure Data into Structured Information using LLMs.


In this project I want to set up a Langgraph pipeline that can read in PDF files from a source directory "DOcuments". I want to create a langgraph pipeline that does the following.


Step 1: Read all the PDF files using tools
Step 2: Use LLMs to understand the context of the documents in PDF files.
Step 3: Understand and Figure out what could be importance feature sets that can be extracted from the documents.
Step 4: Exract these features from the documents and generate a pandas dataframe from the extracted features.
